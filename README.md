# Automated Gong Call Summarization & Notion CRM Updates for Vercel SEs

Automate the capture, summarization, and organization of Gong sales call data for Vercel's Sales Engineers (SEs). This project ensures every customer interaction is documented in a consistent, actionable, and easily accessible format within Notion, and provides SEs with daily digests of critical updates.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Developer Setup

To run or test this project, you will need to:

- **Obtain a SmitheryAI API Key:**
  - Sign up at [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/) and generate an API key.
  - Set this key in your environment (e.g., via `.env.local` as `SMITHERY_API_KEY=your-key`).

- **Update the Notion Database ID:**
  - In `lib/agent.ts`, update the prompt or configuration to use the Notion database ID you want to test against.
  - This ensures the agent writes to the correct Notion workspace/database.

- **Create a Notion Template:**
  - In your Notion database, create a template page formatted as `SE-[name]-Template` (e.g., `SE-Alice-Template`).
  - The agent uses this template to structure call summaries.

## üìÖ Workflow Overview

1. **Ingest Call Data:** Receives Gong call data (mocked for now), extracts company and participants.
2. **Summarize:** Fills in the SE‚Äôs Notion template, using "N/A" for missing info.
3. **Update Notion:** Checks for an existing customer page, updates or creates as needed.
4. **(Planned) Daily Digest:** Will generate and deliver daily digests for SEs.
